NAME
    git-dbic-diff

DESCRIPTION
    git-dbic-diff is a schema management tool for applications utilizing
    DBIx::Class and hosted in a git repository. dbic-diff will produce the
    differences in a DBIx::Class schema between any two git revisions. the
    diff is presented in the form of SQL statements. when applied to a
    database deployment matching the source version, these statements will
    yield the target version.

SYNOPSIS
        $ git dbic-diff [--db <dbtype>] <class> <treeish1> [<treeish2>]
        $ git-dbic-diff [--db <dbtype>] <class> <treeish1> [<treeish2>]

    the second form is invoking the script directly rather than via git.
    this method may be required if you're using perlbrew and git is using
    the system's perl.

    dbtype is any database type recognized by SQL::Translator. the default
    is "MySQL".

    if the second treeish is not provided, the diff is executed against the
    current index. note that modified files must be staged in order to
    appear in the index.

EXAMPLES
        $ git dbic-diff MyApp::Schema 3.1.6 HEAD
        $ git dbic-diff MyApp::Schema HEAD^1 HEAD
        $ git dbic-diff MyApp::Schema fee00055
